      <h3>Something About Tracee...</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="grid_text_container">
      <div class="text1">Tracee Ellis Ross always seems look effortlessly fashionable, on first 
        glance what would appear mismatched seems to come together to create the perfert fashion ensemble. Which leaves us asking how 
        did she make that work? It seems she has an innate sense of style, which is not suprising as she is the daughter of music and
        fashion diva Diana Ross.<br><br>
        
      </div>
      <div class="text2">
          Tracee attended school in New York and Switzerland and sajourned in Paris.
          This manifests in her sense of style as she has the perfect 'mash-up' of New York urban, European chic.
        <br> <br>
        Tracee beacame a model in her teens introducing her to the fashion world early on. She later went on to become a contributing 
        fashion editor to numerous fashion magazines before pursuing her acting career.
        <br><br> 
       
      </div>
      <div class="text3">
        <br>
        More recently Tracee added TED Talk presenter to the many knotches under her belt, where she dicusses inequalities towards women. Please click <a href="https://youtu.be/JoUZ929qoLk" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">here</a> to watch.
        <br>
        Brutally honest and bold Tracee has not been shy in coming forward about her insecuriites and tends to wear 
        her heart on her sleeve. On one occasion she was quoted as saying<q>I am learning every day to allow the space between where I am and where 
        I want to be to inspire me and not terrify me.</q> about her career. She has also been quoted as prolifically saying 
        <q>Wisdom means to choose now what will make sense later.</q><br><br>
        All elements of Tracee's personality tends to be reflected in her style <q>I have a big personality, so I like clothing 
            that also has a big personality.</q>
      </div>
      <div class="text4">
        This is shown in her love for bright bold vibrant colours and big bold statement 
        jewlery pieces. Unafraid to go beyond the trend and at times a little quirky Tracee has become a staple fashion figure
        for women of different backgrounds and ages and is regularly seen in candids on pinterest and various fashion blogs.
        To get a better look at Tracee's style you can click <a href="https://www.instagram.com/traceeellisross/" id="tribute-link-2" target="_blank">here</a> for her instagram page.
       
      </div>
      
      <div class="text5">
        So where does Tracee Ellis Ross get her fashion inspiration from? In W magazine July 2017 Tracee sited Katharine Hepburn, 
        Nina Simone, Diana Ross, Cher, and Bette Midler as her style icons and mentioned that she drew fashion inspiration from her
        environment. Tracee would gain inspiration from anything as small as a flower that she would see in passing. That's not to say that
        she does not get a helping hand from celebrity stylist Karla Welch for the bigger more elaborate occasions involving the red carpet.
      </div>
      <div class="text6">
        <br>
        Tracee is no stranger to designer fashion houses, and has forged ongoing connections with them to the point were 
        she collaborated with JC Penny (a clothing store in the U.S) to launch her own fashion line.
        In true Tracee style she wanted to ensure that the fashion line was inclusive to all women. <q>I really believe that 
        style and looking great does not have to expensive, and I really believe that women are beautiful in all shapes, colors, 
        sizes, and ages. It was really important for me to design a collection of clothes that can be both your armor and your 
        joy at the same time.</q>. (By Tanisha Pina  Nov 9, 2017,www.racked.com). 
        
        It is an exciting time to watch what Tracee will come up with next, but until then we are happy to just take in all of that fashion
        goodness from her candid photos on the fashion blogs and on her instagram page.
